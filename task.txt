You are given a table of raw data from a study on how the physical attributes of the eyes and eyewear of a person affect the tracking error in eye tracking.
Implement a script in Python to process the data to assess the correlations between the attributes and the tracking error.
Concentrate on the correlations that you think could be the most relevant for eye tracking development.
In your presentation, discuss how likely the correlations are to be significant or spurious.
Show your work, explain the processing steps in the report and via code comments.
Return your report as a single PDF file.
Attach the Python code as a separate archive, or ensure that all of it is visible in the PDF report.
